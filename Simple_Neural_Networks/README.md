# Simple-Neural-Network
This directory contains 2 implementations for demonstrating Simple NNs. 

1. Simple NN- From Scratch
It demonstrates a simple NN which can be used for gender classification based on a persom's height and weight. This NN is just a simple NN that does not use any framework such as tensorflow. A custom dataset containing only 4 entries has been used. This NN is only for understanding how NNs work.
