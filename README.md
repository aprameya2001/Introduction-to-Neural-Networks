# Introduction-to-Neural-Networks
Getting started with various Neural Networks through simple implementations...

## Overview
This repository contains various simple but essential implementations to get started with Neural Networks. These simple implementations will give much needed insight into the basics of neural networks. Currenctly this repository contains implementaions for the following NNs:
1. Simple Neural Network (NN)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
